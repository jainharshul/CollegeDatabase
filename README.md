# CollegeDatabase

Project Description:

This project involved the development of a web application for managing and retrieving information related to a university's course offerings, professors, and student records. The application utilized HTML, PHP, and a MySQL database to create a user-friendly interface and facilitate efficient data management.

The web application consisted of multiple components, each serving a specific purpose. The HTML file provided the structure and layout of the web pages, while the PHP files acted as the backend logic for processing user requests and interacting with the database.

The "Professor Portal" section of the application allowed professors to access information about their classes. By entering their social security number (SSN) or course number and section number, professors could retrieve details such as classroom locations, meeting days, and times. The PHP files "professor1.php" and "professor2.php" handled the processing of these requests and retrieved the relevant data from the MySQL database.

On the other hand, the "Student Portal" section enabled students to access their course and grade information. By entering their course number or student ID (CWID), students could view their enrolled courses, corresponding grades, and other relevant details. The PHP files "request2.php" and "request4.php" processed these requests and retrieved the necessary information from the database.

The web application utilized parameterized SQL queries and prepared statements to ensure the security and integrity of the database operations. It established a connection to the MySQL database using the provided credentials and executed the queries to fetch the requested information. The retrieved data was then displayed on the web pages for the users to view and interact with.

Throughout the development process, attention was given to user experience and data accuracy. The web application employed a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy for professors and students to navigate and retrieve the desired information efficiently.

Overall, this project showcased my skills in web development, database management, and PHP programming. It demonstrated my ability to design and implement a functional and secure web application that meets the specific requirements of managing course and student information in an educational setting.
